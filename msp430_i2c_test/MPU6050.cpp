// I2Cdev library collection - MPU6050 I2C device class
// Based on InvenSense MPU-6050 register map document rev. 2.0, 5/19/2011 (RM-MPU-6000A-00)
// 8/24/2011 by Jeff Rowberg <jeff@rowberg.net>
// Updates should (hopefully) always be available at https://github.com/jrowberg/i2cdevlib
//
// Changelog:
//     ... - ongoing debug release

// NOTE: THIS IS ONLY A PARIAL RELEASE. THIS DEVICE CLASS IS CURRENTLY UNDERGOING ACTIVE
// DEVELOPMENT AND IS STILL MISSING SOME IMPORTANT FEATURES. PLEASE KEEP THIS IN MIND IF
// YOU DECIDE TO USE THIS PARTICULAR CODE FOR ANYTHING.

 * all the FIFO enable flags (see below) are enabled and all External Sensor
 * Data registers (Registers 73 to 96) are associated with a Slave device, the
 * contents of registers 59 through 96 will be written in order at the Sample
 * Rate.
 *
 * The contents of the sensor data registers (Registers 59 to 96) are written
 * into the FIFO buffer when their corresponding FIFO enable flags are set to 1
 * in FIFO_EN (Register 35). An additional flag for the sensor data registers
 * associated with I2C Slave 3 can be found in I2C_MST_CTRL (Register 36).
 *
 * If the FIFO buffer has overflowed, the status bit FIFO_OFLOW_INT is
 * automatically set to 1. This bit is located in INT_STATUS (Register 58).
 * When the FIFO buffer has overflowed, the oldest data will be lost and new
 * data will be written to the FIFO.
 *
 * If the FIFO buffer is empty, reading this register will return the last byte
 * that was previously read from the FIFO until new data is available. The user
 * should check FIFO_COUNT to ensure that the FIFO buffer is not read when
 * empty.
